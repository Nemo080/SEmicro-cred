		         <p style="color:SlateBlue"> Reply 1988 takes place during the 80's with
							 five people that are childhood friends. The drama focuses on the many
							 events that occur between this friend group and their families. It also
							 focuses on events that occured during that time period. </p>
						 <p style="color:SlateBlue"> I enjoyed watching this drama as it displayed
							values that I was able to relate to. For example, it provided with a
							value of keeping a lasting relationship with both family and friends
							even after many years go by.</p>
