         <p style="color:SlateBlue"> Hosital Playlist revolves around five college friends
					  that become a variety of different doctors. Just like Reply 1988, this drama
						also focuses on friendship. Even with a busy schedule of being a docter, these five
						friends still manage to have a close relationship.</p>
				<p style="color:SlateBlue"> Due to this drama focusing on friendship, I enjoyed it just
					like I did with Reply 1988. It focused on keeping a long lasting friendship even
					through rough times. I admired their friendship and would definately want to have
					long lasting relationships with my friends. </p>
