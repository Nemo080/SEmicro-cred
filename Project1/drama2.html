         <p style="color:SlateBlue"> It's Okay To Not Okay is about a childhood acquaintances
				 that meet up again as adults. There are many events that led to them having psychological
				 trauma from their past which are intertwined. Thus, they work together to overcome these
			   traumas and live a better life.</p>
				 <p style="color:SlateBlue"> I enjoyed how this drama focuses a lot on psychological traumas how it is
					 important to overcome it in order to be able to have a healthy mentality. They acknowledged and
					 displayed that the process of overcoming trauma isn't an easy thing to do. You have to be able to
					 willing to heal and move on in order to overcome it. The way the drama focused on mental health
					 made me think deeper about my own mental health and that I should make better decisions that won't
					 have a negative impact on my mental health. </p>
