<p>Hi! I am a sophomore at Baruch College, majoring in Marketing Management. I have an interest in coding although I have zero knowledge in it. I decided to take this micro-credential to challenge my interest in the field and see if I am willing to invest myself in it full time. I also want to expand my knowledge in the field and learn something new. Maybe along the way of learning code, I can learn something about myself. Since we are all humans and everyday is a learning process. ;) </p>
